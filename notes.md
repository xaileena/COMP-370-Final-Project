### Notes During Manual Filtering
- Remove any international sources as most of the time they talk about politics regarding their own country in relation to Mark Carney. This is biased towards whether Canada is on good/bad terms with the concerning country and less about Mark Carney as a politician. Note that this is also applicable to the US, but we are interested in North American coverage.
    - e.g. Al Jazeera, Japan Today, BBC News, The Times of India
- Remove any irrelevant sources i.e. non-news outlets
    - e.g. Online forums (e.g. Free Republic), entertainment blogs etc.
    - Also, there's a Football coach named Mark Carney which appear in sports news that we had to filter out
- Keep aggregators and opiniated sources (e.g. from a journalist in a blog)
- Remove any fake news website (e.g. theconservativetreehouse)
